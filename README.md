# ðŸ¤– Advanced Machine Learning

This repository contains projects developed using **Gaussian Processes** and **Mixture Models**, both of which are key algorithms for enhancing the understanding of **Neural Networks**.

- **Gaussian Processes**: A powerful probabilistic model used for regression and classification tasks, offering flexibility in handling uncertainty.
- **Mixture Models**: A probabilistic model for representing the presence of subpopulations within an overall population, often used for clustering and density estimation.

These methods are fundamental in the broader field of advanced machine learning.
